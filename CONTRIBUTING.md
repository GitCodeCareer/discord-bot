## Contributing
Getting started with your first pull request (PR) is easy! Just follow these steps...

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account.
2. Clone the forked repository to a directory on your computer.
3. Run `npm install` from within the directory. If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), feel free to use that instead.
4. Create a new development bot at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/. Be sure to also create a bot user in order to interact with it.
5. Create a new project at https://console.firebase.google.com/. Go to **Settings** then **Add an application** and under **Firebase SDK snippet**, choose **CDN**. Copy/Paste correct values in `.env`
6. Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` and fill in the appropriate values from the Discord Developer portal and from Firebase Console
7. Create a new javascript file in the commands folder that is named after the command you want to add. If you want to add a new event instead, make the event in `index.js`.
8. To test the bot, run `node index.js`
9. Make sure to debug the new command and test it a lot. If you need help, ask in the CodeCareer Discord anytime! Use the [#open-source-ðŸ˜º](https://discord.gg/nVCtqvQ) channel. When you are ready to submit the PR, head back to this page and click `New pull request`.
10. Wait patiently for an admin to look it over and if everything checks out, it will be merged.
